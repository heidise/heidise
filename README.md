# Hi there, I'm Heidi üëã

Here are some course related example projects which I have done myself or been part of. Each project has a short introduction of what it is about and some of them also have been properly documented.

## üöÄ Projects

### [Tourism Planner](https://github.com/heidise/tourism_planner)
Tourism planner is a web application (Java backend with React+Redux frontend) in which user can use different filtering criterias to find suitable events. After selecting the needed criteria, user can select a day from the calendar to search for events. 
User can select any event to dislay more basic information and weather graphs for that day. 
Backend fetches data from two different APIs and combines them and frontend can query this combined data from the backend. I was part of the frontend team.

### [Sisu](https://github.com/heidise/Sisu)
SISU is a study planning application done with Java. The basic idea of the study planner is to fetch study related data from Kori API. 
User can register and log in to the system and display and modify their study plans depending on which degree they have chosen.
My main responsibility was to fetch data and modify it on the backend.

### [Sandwich shop](https://github.com/heidise/sandwich_shop)
Sandwich shop is a single page application done with JavaScript and React in which the user can order different sandwiches. Order processes in the backend and frontend displayes the current state of the order.
My main responsilities were user endpoint, some parts of the frontend, Swagger documentation and fixing some bugs.

### [Structures and algorithms -project](https://github.com/heidise/structures_and_algorithms)
The main idea of this project was to select and use structures and algorithms from C++ reference to save and use data from different affiliations, publications and references. The course provided tests and UI for testing out the program but datastructure and algorithm part was done by me. In addition, implemented functions' performance was estimated.

### [NysseMeni game (partial implementation)](https://github.com/heidise/Nyssemeni_game)
NysseMeni game has been done with C++ using Qt Creator. The idea of the game is that you can shoot busses to collect points and the player with the most points wins. 
The course provided us he course provided the base for getting real time data of busses around Tampere and moving the busses on the map (CourseLib part) and rest of the game implementation was left for the students. CourseLib implementation is not included here and therefore this is only an example of C++ project.
